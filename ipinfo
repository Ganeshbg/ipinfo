How to get the Location info of an IP address

Go to ipinfo.io and signup to their free service. In free service, we can make 1000 requests per day. They also have paid service which lets us make more requests on daily basis.

Once you signup, you will get a mail with a token. You need to use this token to make requests.

For emample http://ipinfo.io/?token=your_token

Then you can do curl from your command line

curl http://ipinfo.io/?token=your_token : This will give your location details.

If you want the location details of an IP

curl http://ipinfo.io/8.8.8.8?token=your_token

You can replace 8.8.8.8 with the IP that you want to search for. This will send us the data in json format and we can store the response for future use.

A sample output:
